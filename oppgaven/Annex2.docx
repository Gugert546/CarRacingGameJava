1. Production Description 
1.1 Overview 
(Provide a short description of your product. What does it do? Who is the target user? 
What problem does it solve?) 
 
1.2 Features 
(List and briefly explain the main features of your product.) 
 
1.3 Application of Key Lessons 
(Describe how you applied the following concepts in your program. Provide specific details 
and explain why you chose certain implementations.) 
1.3.1 Animation (JavaFX)  
(How did you implement animation? Which classes (e.g., Timeline, Transition) 
were used?) 
1.3.2 Exception Handling  
(What errors could occur, and how did you handle them? Did you create custom 
exceptions?) 
1.3.3 Text I/O  
  
4 
 
(How does your program read/write text files? Where is this used in your 
program?) 
1.3.4 Binary I/O (including Object Serialization)  
(What objects/data are stored in binary form? Why did you choose binary I/O 
instead of text I/O?) 
 
2. Challenges & Problem-Solving Approach 
(Describe at least two major challenges you encountered during development and how you 
solved them. Be specific!)

___ No AI tools were used. 
___ Yes, AI was used (explain how below). 
 
5.2 AI Code Modifications 
(If AI was used, describe how you modified and improved the AI-generated content.) 
 
AI-Generated Code Modifications Made Reason for Changes 
Suggested an animation loop Adjusted speed and 
timing 
Prevent animation lag 
Provided basic exception 
handling 
Added custom error 
messages 
Improved debugging
